## Overview
***Bug Arena*** is a single-player 2D action game developed in Unity. The player controls the Bug that fights for its life in the arena against a crowd of Ticks.

## Gameplay
The goal of the game is to stay alive as long as possible while fighting enemies with weapons scattered around. The main feature of the game is that all weapons break after one use, so it is important to use them wisely.

For defeating enemies, the player is awarded points, but as the score increases, the game becomes more difficult.

### Items
There are four types of items that differ in weight, speed, usage and the probability of spawning in the arena.
+ ***Rock*** - projectile weapon, that can kill only one target.
+ ***Sword*** - melee weapon, that deals damage with a swing in the direction of attack. Especially useful when the player is surrounded.
+ ***Bow*** - ranged weapon that fires an arrow which hits enemies in the direction of flight. It is most effective for killing enemies lined up in a row.
+ ***Bomb*** - thrown weapon that detonates on hit with the ground, creating an explosion in the area of impact. Useful for defeating groups of enemies in a distance.

### Enemies
+ ***Ticks*** - type of enemies that wander around and start chasing the player when he is nearby. When they get close enough, they slow down the player and start dealing damage. The more enemies surround the player, the harder it is to escape.

## Controls
***WASD*** - movement\
***MOUSE*** - aim\
***LMB*** - use equipped item\
***RMB*** - drop equipped item\
***ESC*** - pause/resume game
